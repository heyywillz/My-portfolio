            <p>
              I’m Atabisa Williams, a Software Engineer specializing in Frontend
              Development with 2 years of professional experience and currently
              a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student. I have a passion for
              crafting clean, responsive, and user-focused web applications,
              turning complex problems into intuitive interfaces that balance
              functionality with aesthetics. My strength lies in combining
              technical expertise with creativity to deliver solutions that are
              both efficient and visually compelling.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve built and contributed to projects that showcase my ability to
              transform design concepts into scalable, high-quality code using
              modern web technologies. While my primary focus is frontend
              development, I’m also expanding my skills across the full stack to
              enhance end-to-end application development. I’m eager to bring
              value to innovative teams, contribute to impactful projects, and
              continue growing as a developer dedicated to excellence in user
              experience.
